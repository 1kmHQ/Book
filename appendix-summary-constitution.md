## 8 Foundational Truths

1. **The provider is the platform.** Without them, nothing exists.

2. **Trust is local.** It's built face-to-face, one kilometre at a time.

3. **Rural is not "urban minus."** It's a different world with different rules.

4. **Commission kills prosperity.** 5% enables it; 20% destroys it.

5. **Cash is infrastructure.** Meet people where they are.

6. **Zones are atoms.** Everything scales from healthy local units.

7. **Slow is sustainable.** Fast growth on weak foundations collapses.

8. **Extraction is death.** The moment we extract, we become what we oppose.

## 6 Economic Laws

1. **The Commission Law**: Platform commission never exceeds 5% for rides, 3% for business logistics.

2. **The Payout Law**: Providers can access their earnings instantly. We never hold float.

3. **The Pricing Law**: No surge. No hidden fees. Transparent, fair, stable.

4. **The Local Capture Law**: 95%+ of fare value stays with the provider and zone.

5. **The Sustainability Law**: Each zone must reach local profitability. No perpetual subsidies.

6. **The Patient Capital Law**: No exit-driven growth. Build for decades, not quarters.

## 4 Governance Rules

1. **Federal, Not Central**: Zones govern locally; platform provides tools and standards.

2. **Stakeholder Voice**: Providers, zone admins, and customers have formal input into policy.

3. **Principle Override**: When rules conflict with principles, principles win.

4. **Succession Planning**: Leaders come from within. Mission continuity over personal legacy.

## The Decision Test

When facing any decision:

> **If it strengthens trust or prosperity, proceed.**
> **If it weakens either, stop.**

## The Constitutional Hierarchy

1. **Foundational Truths** — Non-negotiable beliefs
2. **Principles** — Guides for decisions
3. **Economic Laws** — Constraints on the model
4. **Governance Rules** — How power operates
5. **Policies** — Changeable specifics
6. **Tactics** — Day-to-day choices

Higher levels override lower levels. When in doubt, look up the hierarchy.
