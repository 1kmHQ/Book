## The Three Core Beliefs

These never change. Everything else is built on them.

| # | Core Belief | What It Means |
|---|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | **The Provider is the Platform** | Without drivers, nothing exists. They're not "supply" — they're the reason we exist. |
| 2 | **Trust is the Only Moat** | We have no advantage that can't be copied except trust. Trust compounds; everything else decays. |
| 3 | **We Are Infrastructure, Not Extraction** | We enable movement; we don't tax it. Value created locally stays local. |

**When any decision conflicts with a core belief, the core belief wins. Always.**

## The Eight Guiding Principles

These rarely change. They guide decisions when core beliefs don't immediately resolve the question.

| # | Principle | Core Idea | The Test |
|---|-----------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | **Provider Prosperity First** | Provider wellbeing is the foundation | Would a thoughtful provider say this respects them? |
| 2 | **Fairness Over Profit** | Fair to all, even when unfairness would be profitable | Could we explain this to a farmer without embarrassment? |
| 3 | **Local Knowledge, Local Power** | Those who understand local context make local decisions | Are people closest to the problem empowered to solve it? |
| 4 | **Simplicity Over Cleverness** | Simple systems beat clever ones | Can a first-time user understand this without help? |
| 5 | **Meet People Where They Are** | Cash, offline, low-tech — serve reality | Does this work for someone with a basic phone? |
| 6 | **Dignity In Every Interaction** | Everyone deserves respect | Would we want our family on the receiving end? |
| 7 | **Long-Term Over Short-Term** | Build as if we'll be here in 20 years | Will this decision still look right in five years? |
| 8 | **Admit Mistakes Quickly** | When wrong, say so, then fix it | Would we be comfortable if this was in the press? |

## The Economic Laws

| # | Law | Specifics |
|---|-----|-----------|
| 1 | **Low Commission** | 2-5% for rides, never more. Lower than industry standard (15-25%). |
| 2 | **Instant Payouts** | Providers can access earnings immediately. We never hold float for profit. |
| 3 | **No Surge Pricing** | Same ride, same price, any time. Demand-supply balanced through provider incentives, not customer penalty. |
| 4 | **Local Value Capture** | 95%+ of fare stays with provider and zone. Money flows to those who do the work. |
| 5 | **Zone Sustainability** | Each zone must reach local profitability. No perpetual subsidies. |
| 6 | **Patient Growth** | No exit-driven timelines. Build for decades, not quarters. |

## The Governance Rules

| # | Rule | What It Means |
|---|------|---------------|
| 1 | **Federal, Not Central** | Zones govern locally; platform provides tools and standards |
| 2 | **Stakeholder Voice** | Providers, zone admins, and customers have formal input into policy |
| 3 | **Belief Override** | When rules conflict with core beliefs, beliefs win |
| 4 | **Succession Planning** | Leaders come from within. Mission continuity over personal legacy |

## The Hierarchy

When things conflict, higher levels win:

```
1. CORE BELIEFS (3)      ← Never change
         ↓
2. PRINCIPLES (8)        ← Rarely change
         ↓
3. ECONOMIC LAWS (6)     ← Stable constraints
         ↓
4. GOVERNANCE RULES (4)  ← How power operates
         ↓
5. POLICIES              ← Can change as needed
         ↓
6. TACTICS               ← Day-to-day choices
```

## The Decision Test

When facing any decision:

> **Does it strengthen trust or prosperity?** → Proceed
> **Does it weaken either?** → Stop

Not "does it improve metrics." Not "does it satisfy investors." 

Trust and prosperity. That's it.

## Quick Reference: What We Are / What We're Not

| We Are | We Are Not |
|--------|------------|
| Infrastructure | An app |
| Provider-first | Growth-first |
| Hyperlocal | Pan-India from day one |
| Patient | Blitz-scaling |
| Transparent | Clever |
| Fair | Extractive |
| Rural-native | Urban-exported |
| Trust-based | Transaction-based |
| Long-term | Exit-seeking |

## The One Sentence

If you remember nothing else:

> **Make movement predictable for those who depend on it, and prosperous for those who provide it.**

## What is 1km?

A platform where you can book local vehicles for rides and deliveries in rural India.

Three services:
- **Personal rides** — Autos, cabs, vehicles for travel
- **Goods & deliveries** — Farm to market, shop to customer
- **Business logistics** — Multi-vehicle booking, fleet tracking, invoicing

The vehicles exist. The drivers exist. The demand exists. 1km is the bridge.
